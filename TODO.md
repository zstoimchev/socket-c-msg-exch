# This is TODO list for features to be implemented

- Add IP to each client, so they are distinct

- Broadcast all the messages to each client, display them as in the server terminal

- Encrypt the messages

- Ability to send private messages, from one to another client

- Distributivity/Decentralization: make it not depend on central server
