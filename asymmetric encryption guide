Yes, you can definitely encrypt the messages in your client-server application. One common way to do this is by using SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security), which is a protocol for encrypting information over the internet.

Here’s a high-level overview of what you need to do:

Generate a public-private key pair: When a new client connects, you can generate a public-private key pair for that client. The private key should be kept secret and stored securely on the client side, while the public key can be shared with the server.

Encrypt the messages: When sending a message, the client can use the server’s public key to encrypt the message. This ensures that only the server, which has the corresponding private key, can decrypt and read the message.

Decrypt the messages: When the server receives an encrypted message, it can use its private key to decrypt the message.

Broadcast the messages: When the server needs to broadcast a message to all clients, it can use each client’s public key to encrypt the message. Each client can then use its private key to decrypt the message.

This is a simplified explanation and actual implementation might require dealing with more details. For example, in practice, symmetric encryption is often used after asymmetric encryption due to performance reasons. The public-private key pair is used to securely share a symmetric key, which is then used for the actual message encryption and decryption.
